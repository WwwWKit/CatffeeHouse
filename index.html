                    <h3>Welcome</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to the Catffee House website, your tea room & cat bar in Serdang.</p>
                    <p>Catffee House is home to <span>10</span> cats with <span>age ranging from 7 to 15+</span>. Cats are senior, generally calmer around humans.</p>
                    <p>With us, the cats form <span>real little family</span> , all well socialized, all well anchored in their territory, and (therefore!) all ready to welcome you with open paws. And it is precisely because <span>they love their life as residents here</span> that our little furballs are so comfortable. However, <span>BE CAREFUL:</span> if you come to Catffee House expecting a horde of cats hungry for cuddles and games to jump at your throat, you are on the wrong track… Like all cats, our residents sleep twelve to sixteen hours a day and are therefore not always “willing”.</p>

                    <h3>Our Tea Room</h3>
                    <p>We offer <span>a cozy restaurant to enjoy the hearty brunch</span> during the day, <span>a tea room with delicious pastries</span> from our chef. Our regulars often tell us:</p>
                    <p><span>" The first time, you come to Catffee House for your cats. The following times, we come back for his card! "</span></p>
                    <p>We have always been keen to <span>offer a positive experience to our visitors</span>. We thought of our cat bar as <span>a real tea room and restaurant</span> , with its pastries and homemade dishes, its aesthetic setting and its comfortable furniture. We also <span>focused on decorating the place and increasing the number of facilities</span> for our cats so that our visitors are always more satisfied with their stay with us.</p>
